Title: Weshare

Version
We hope that WeShare helps create a safer environment by helping people manage their waste. And we will be encouraging them to do so by the idea that they can get some amount of money instead of just throwing things away. We also want to help others save money by getting good quality second-hand things that they need.  Along with building a cooperative society that gives a helping hand to those in need by donating our stuff to them.
Thus, we hope that WeShare would help us: protect the environment by managing our waste / minimizing human's impact on the environment, get people the stuff they need/want at a lower cost (like by swapping with other users) or for free and make the community more unified on reducing environmental impact and on financial responsibility.

Automated Tests: ????????????
Try to ask that if the build method in Xcode count as testing, if we screenshot the code page after build. 
Also, xcode automatically contain a test code itself, how can we use that or modify that some way to let it be the automate test file.
