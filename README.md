# Title: WeShare

# Description:  

Our project aims to reduce the waste in our environment. As a lot of people throw
away things that they do not need anymore or because they stopped using them,
and sometimes a lot of these stuff are still in a pretty good usable state.
Thus we will be offering people a better path where they can benefit from their
waste by giving them two choices: either get rid of it quickly and easily or donate it to
someone who needs them, we might add a chooice to allow people to swap thier things that they don't   
need to get something else that they nedd. Using “one man's trash is another man's treasure” as
our moto. 


# Vision statement:

We hope that WeShare helps create a safer environment by helping people
manage their waste. And we will be encouraging them to do so by the idea that
they can get some amount of money instead of just throwing things away. We also
want to help others save money by getting good quality second-hand things that
they need.  Along with building a cooperative society that gives a helping hand to those in need by donating our
stuff to them.

Thus, we hope that WeShare would help us: protect the environment by managing our waste / minimizing 
human's impact on the environment, get people the stuff they need/want at a lower cost (like by swapping with other users) or 
for free and make the community more unified on reducing environmental impact and on financial responsibility.


# Motivation: 

In college, in one hand, students always have plenty of cool things, but sometimes there are very useful
stuff that are never used or not needed, which gave us a good opportunity to create website or
an App to give students the place where they can sell the things they don't need, or donate them
ot swap them to other students or someone else who needs them. On the other hand, new things are
quite expensive for college students. We really want to save some money for other things. It will be so 
great to have such convienent resource to access.

Basically, this project will have three major functions, which are donating, second-hand selling 
and swapping, with the utility of map, gps, facial recognition methods (if it is allowed).


# Risks:

-Working environment or language new to some team members  
-No prior experience working with the people on the team  
-Limited/No IOS development, stucking on some sepecific stage
-We want to achieve too much but it might br hard to finish all of them in the given time


# Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risks

-We will try to get more familiar with the language by getting more practice and doing more research  
-The team will meet often so people get to know each other more and get used to the other members of the team.  
-We will to look for more resources and get help from more experienced people.
