# Title: Title of the project


# Description: Short description of the project 


# Vision statement: (what you would tell potential customers)
Swap things with people around you.
Save money and get good quality second-hand things that you need.
Be environmental-friendly by putting things which you don't need but are still with good quality to those who need it.

# Motivation: for working on this particular project 
In college, students always have cool things, but sometimes, there are very useful stuff but they are never be used. It is a good opportunity to bring on an website to give students the place that they can sell the things they don't need, swap with other students or donate the things they don't need.


# Risks: to project completion (these could include):
-Working environment or language new to some team members
-No prior experience working with the people on the team
-Lack of availability of some needed resource, etc
-Expectation is too high that hard to reach
-Hard to find aggrement for some points


# Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk
