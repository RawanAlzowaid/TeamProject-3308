# Title: OneMan's Treasure

# Description:  

Our project aims to reduce the waste in our environment. As a lot of people throw
away things that they do not need anymore or because they stopped using them,
and sometimes a lot of these stuff are still in a pretty good usable state.
Thus we will be offering people a better path where they can benefit from their
waste by giving them two choices: either get rid of it quickly and easily or donate it to
someone who needs them, using “one man's trash is another man's treasure” as
our moto. (Possibily: added swap choice that users will be able to swap their waste stuff 
from other people's waste that they need)


# Vision statement: (what you would tell potential customers)

We hope that OneMan's Treasure helps create a safer environment by helping people
manage their waste. And we will be encouraging them to do so by the idea that
they can get some amount of money instead of just throwing things away. We also
want to help others save money by getting good quality second-hand things that
they need.  Along with build a cooperative society that gives a helping hand to those in need by donating our
stuff to them.

Thus, we hope that OneMan's Treasure would help us: protect the environment by managing our waste / minimizing 
human's impact on environment, get people the stuff they need/want at a lower cost (swap with other users) or for free and make the community more unified on reducing environmental impact and on financial responsibility.


# Motivation: (for working on this particular project) 

In college, in one hand, students always have plenty of cool things, but sometimes, there are very useful
stuff that are never used or not needed anymore. Which gave us a good opportunity to create website or
an App to give students the place where they can sell the things they don't need, or donate them
(swapping them)to other students or someone else who needs them. One the other hand, new things are
expensive that for university students, we really want to save some money for other things.
It will be so great to have such convienent resource to access.

Basically, this project will have three major functions, which are donating/, second-hand selling 
and swaping, with the utility of map, gps, facial recognition methods (if it is allowed).


# Risks: (for project completion)

-Working environment or language new to some team members  
-No prior experience working with the people on the team  
-Limited/No IOS development, stucking on some sepecific stage
- Limited access to devices to test on. (Iphones not of the latest model/version/software patch)
-To much want to achieve but hard to finish all of them


# Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risks

-We will try to get more familiar with the language by getting more practice and doing more research  
-The team will meet often so people get to know each other more and get used to the other members of the team.  


# List of requirements: 

-6 user stories with unique ID numbers, written in the format “As a [role], I want to [do X] so that I can [benefit with Y]” , with a size where the size can be story points or time estimate. 
*[optional] you can add priority (Critical, High, Med, Low, Nice-to-have), you can add topic/area (e.g., Login, Profile, DB, etc.), you can add user type (e.g., Admin, end user, potential customer,…)  

->01)As a student, I want to be able to find needed school supplies so that I can save money.  

->02)As a busy parent, I want to be able to show my location so that people who are intrested in the items can see where I am and I dont have to take time to drive somewhere to drop it off.  

->03)As a mover, I want to be able to get rid of large items like furniture so that I dont have to pay the large fee trash companies charge.

->04)As an environmentally concious member of the community, I would like to have someone reuse my items so I am not contributing to landfills and ocean trash problems.

->05)As a small business owner that refurbishes items / resells them, I want to be connected to people who dont have time/effort to post things to ebay or craigslist, so that I can have more previously overlooked items for my store.

->06)As a bored bus-rider, I want something to scroll through to pass the time that maybe I can benefit from if I happen to find something cool.
